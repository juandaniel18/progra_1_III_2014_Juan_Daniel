I learned that the cloud is one of the most important things in the internet, with the cloud you can avoid carry USB or disks and you can avoid lose information for some hardware or software problem in your computer. Nowadays you can make a server without waste a lot of money in special hardware and a whole room with air conditioner, now you can pay monthly for the hardware that you need make up a server and it is located in somewhere of United States so you do not need a special room to keep your computer server working all the day, so the only thing that you need is the software and you can build it as you want and you can access to the computers in USA through a remote computer.

I learned too that nowadays the hardware'servers do not take a whole room and you can make a lot of virtual servers in a little computer, you can make around one hundred of them in a little device and all this is possibles thanks to the cloud.
